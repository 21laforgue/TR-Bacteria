For the moment the more interesting document to see is the `Compare_matches.ipynb`.
The `Interface` folder is an idea to have an interactive tool to compare and label genomes from different families, it is not finished even though the html code is done.
The `Auto_comparison.ipynb` is a jupyter notebook that might help with the interface, in particular when we will have to browse files and do the comparisons.
There are several other files that are basically just outputs.
The next things to do are :
- For each graph, instead of plotting a -3 and a -4 slope straight line, determine the -3 and the -4 linear approximations. Then, calculate the distance to each line to the points to create features according to the power laws.
- Finishing the interface to have something more interactive.
