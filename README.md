# TR-Sant√©-Bacteria

Here is the GitHub containing all the information related to the bioinformatics internship of 2 months I did at the CBIO, a research laboratory from Mines Paris - PSL and the Institut Curie. I gather here the link to the GitHub of the project as well as the scientific article finally produced. Do not hesitate to write to me if you have any questions!  

The most interesting document to see is the `Compare_matches.ipynb`.
The rest of the files are basically only `outputs` or `fasta files`, they might be interesting to look to figure out how the code works, especially concerning the `Nucmer` tools considering alignment tools.
